# Tempo Home Assistant integration

Right now this integration is pretty basic, it contains all time statics such as calories burned, weight lifted, etc. It also contains your current weight recommendations - however, this seems to be a non-existing functionality in the api as it does not seem to update for me. I am leaving it for now and if any users are able ti get them to change, please let me know!
